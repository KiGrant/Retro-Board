#Retro-Board

Kishon's Retro-Board

This is my first project for the Albanycancode 2019 JavaScript Frameworks class. Using React.js, I was able to create an app that can be used to discuss a team's progress after a sprint. There are three catogories to chose from in the retro-board. You can also add, edit, and delete the cards. Enjoy!
